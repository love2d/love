## disable-cpu-exts: (global)
#  Disables use of specialized methods that use specific CPU intrinsics.
#  Certain methods may utilize CPU extensions for improved performance, and
#  this option is useful for preventing some or all of those methods from being
#  used. The available extensions are: sse, sse2, sse3, sse4.1, and neon.
#  Specifying 'all' disables use of all such specialized methods.

## drivers: (global)
#  Sets the backend driver list order, comma-seperated. Unknown backends and
#  duplicated names are ignored. Unlisted backends won't be considered for use
#  unless the list is ended with a comma (e.g. 'oss,' will try OSS first before
#  other backends, while 'oss' will try OSS only). Backends prepended with -
#  won't be considered for use (e.g. '-oss,' will try all available backends
#  except OSS). An empty list means to try all backends.
drivers = wave

## channels:
#  Sets the output channel configuration. If left unspecified, one will try to
#  be detected from the system, and defaulting to stereo. The available values
#  are: mono, stereo, quad, surround51, surround51rear, surround61, surround71,
#  ambi1, ambi2, ambi3. Note that the ambi* configurations provide ambisonic
#  channels of the given order (using ACN ordering and SN3D normalization by
#  default), which need to be decoded to play correctly on speakers.
#channels =

## sample-type:
#  Sets the output sample type. Currently, all mixing is done with 32-bit float
#  and converted to the output sample type as needed. Available values are:
#  int8    - signed 8-bit int
#  uint8   - unsigned 8-bit int
#  int16   - signed 16-bit int

#  headphones, HRTF or crossfeed filters may be used for better audio quality.
#  Valid settings are auto, speakers, and headphones.
#stereo-mode = auto

## stereo-encoding:
#  Specifies the encoding method for non-HRTF stereo output. 'panpot' (default)
#  uses standard amplitude panning (aka pair-wise, stereo pair, etc) between
#  -30 and +30 degrees, while 'uhj' creates stereo-compatible two-channel UHJ
#  output, which encodes some surround sound information into stereo output
#  that can be decoded with a surround sound receiver. If crossfeed filters are
#  used, UHJ is disabled.

#  Specifies the channel order and normalization for the "ambi*" set of channel
#  configurations. Valid settings are: fuma, acn+sn3d, acn+n3d
#ambi-format = acn+sn3d

## hrtf:
#  Controls HRTF processing. These filters provide better spatialization of
#  sounds while using headphones, but do require a bit more CPU power. The
#  default filters will only work with 44100hz or 48000hz stereo output. While
#  HRTF is used, the cf_level option is ignored. Setting this to auto (default)
#  will allow HRTF to be used when headphones are detected or the app requests
#  it, while setting true or false will forcefully enable or disable HRTF
#  respectively.
#hrtf = auto

## default-hrtf:
#  Specifies the default HRTF to use. When multiple HRTFs are available, this
#  determines the preferred one to use if none are specifically requested. Note
#  that this is the enumerated HRTF name, not necessarily the filename.
#default-hrtf =

## hrtf-paths:
#  Specifies a comma-separated list of paths containing HRTF data sets. The
#  format of the files are described in docs/hrtf.txt. The files within the
#  directories must have the .mhr file extension to be recognized. By default,
#  OS-dependent data paths will be used. They will also be used if the list
#  ends with a comma. On Windows this is:

## resampler: (global)
#  Selects the resampler used when mixing sources. Valid values are:
#  point - nearest sample, no interpolation
#  linear - extrapolates samples using a linear slope between samples
#  cubic - extrapolates samples using a Catmull-Rom spline
#  bsinc12 - extrapolates samples using a band-limited Sinc filter (varying
#            between 12 and 24 points, with anti-aliasing)

## rt-prio: (global)
#  Sets real-time priority for the mixing thread. Not all drivers may use this
#  (eg. PortAudio) as they already control the priority of the mixing thread.
#  0 and negative values will disable it. Note that this may constitute a

## slots:
#  Sets the maximum number of Auxiliary Effect Slots an app can create. A slot

## sends:
#  Limits the number of auxiliary sends allowed per source. Setting this higher

## front-stablizer:
#  Applies filters to "stablize" front sound imaging. A psychoacoustic method
#  is used to generate a front-center channel signal from the front-left and

## dither-depth:
#  Quantization bit-depth for dithered output. A value of 0 (or less) will
#  match the output sample depth. For int32, uint32, and float32 output, 0 will
#  disable dithering because they're at or beyond the rendered precision. The
#  maximum dither depth is 24.
#dither-depth = 0

## volume-adjust:
#  A global volume adjustment for source output, expressed in decibels. The
#  value is logarithmic, so +6 will be a scale of (approximately) 2x, +12 will
#  be a scale of 4x, etc. Similarly, -6 will be x1/2, and -12 is about x1/4. A
#  value of 0 means no change.

#  fshifter
#excludefx =

## default-reverb: (global)
#  A reverb preset that applies by default to all sources on send 0
#  (applications that set their own slots on send 0 will override this).
#  Available presets are: None, Generic, PaddedCell, Room, Bathroom,
#  Livingroom, Stoneroom, Auditorium, ConcertHall, Cave, Arena, Hangar,

## trap-alc-error: (global)

#trap-alc-error = false

## trap-al-error: (global)

#  dependent processing, creating a better reproduction of 3D sound rendering
#  over surround sound speakers. Enabling this also requires specifying decoder
#  configuration files for the appropriate speaker configuration you intend to
#  use (see the quad, surround51, etc options below). Currently, up to third-
#  order decoding is supported.
hq-mode = false

## distance-comp:
#  Enables compensation for the speakers' relative distances to the listener.
#  This applies the necessary delays and attenuation to make the speakers

#  playback of 3D sound rendering. Requires the proper distances to be
#  specified in the decoder configuration file.
distance-comp = true

## nfc:
#  Enables near-field control filters. This simulates and compensates for low-
#  frequency effects caused by the curvature of nearby sound-waves, which
#  creates a more realistic perception of sound distance. Note that the effect
#  may be stronger or weaker than intended if the application doesn't use or
#  specify an appropriate unit scale, or if incorrect speaker distances are set
#  in the decoder configuration file. Requires hq-mode to be enabled.
nfc = true

## nfc-ref-delay
#  Specifies the reference delay value for ambisonic output. When channels is
#  set to one of the ambi* formats, this option enables NFC-HOA output with the
#  specified Reference Delay parameter. The specified value can then be shared
#  with an appropriate NFC-HOA decoder to reproduce correct near-field effects.
#  Keep in mind that despite being designed for higher-order ambisonics, this
